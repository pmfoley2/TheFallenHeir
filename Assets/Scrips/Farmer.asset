  dialogue:
  - My prince...You're alive...I'm not sure exactly what happened, but I know your
    family was taken hostage in that castle.
  - From what I heard, it was one of the rival familes from across the river. They
    wanted new land and heard that your father was getting sick.
  - I'd first go over to that camp over there and try to remember as much as you
    can about your training, and then go out and try to rescue your family.
  - Good luck, my prince.
  playerDialogue:
  - Who did this?
  - What do I do?
  - Alright, thank you.
